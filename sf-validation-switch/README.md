# Salesforce Validation Rule Switch

## Project Overview
Salesforce Validation Rule Switch is a web application that allows users
to authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and view validation rules
from the Account object using Salesforce Metadata API.

## Features
- Salesforce OAuth 2.0 Login
- Fetch validation rules from Account object
- Display active/inactive status
- UI toggle to simulate enable/disable of validation rules
- Backend integration using Node.js and jsforce

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Salesforce: OAuth 2.0, Metadata API

## Validation Rule Toggle Limitation
Salesforce does not support real-time enable or disable of validation rules
directly via REST or Tooling APIs.

Enabling or disabling a validation rule requires a Metadata deployment
process involving XML retrieval and deployment.

The toggle implemented in this application is for demonstration purposes
to represent how the feature would behave in a real-world scenario.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
``` 

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
